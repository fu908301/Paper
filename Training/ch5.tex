\chapter{Conclusion}
\vspace*{30pt}

The time series data is a collection of data values generally at
uniform interval of time to reflect certain behavior of an entity.
Moreover, identifying periodic patterns can reveal important
observations about the behavior and future trends of the case
representation by the time series data. In this paper, we have
proposed the time-position method to mine the periodicity patterns.
We have avoided to traverse some paths repeatedly in traversing the
graph step. From our performance study, we have shown that our
method is more efficient than the Rasheed \emph{et al}'s approach.
