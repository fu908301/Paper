\chapter{Introduction}
\vspace*{30pt} Data mining is the process of discovering new
patterns from large datasets. It finds useful information from data
in databases \cite{Iosif2015}. Periodicity mining is used for
predicting trends in time series data \cite{Pablo2006, Pippa2016,
Mohammadi2015}. Applications of periodicity mining in time series
data include temperature, stock prices depicted in the financial
market, gene expression data analysis, etc \cite{Parvez2014,
Abd2010}. In general, there are three types of periodic patterns
which can be detected in the time series data \cite{Iosif2015}: (1)
symbol periodicity, (2) sequence periodicity or partial periodic
patterns, and (3) segment or full-cycle periodicity. (Note that the
time series data is mostly discretized before it is analyzed.)
