\chapter{Related Work}
\vspace*{30pt} Some applications require that periodic patterns must
satisfy two extra conditions including \textsl{Min\_count} and
\textsl{Max\_distance} \cite{Anwar2015}. Parameter
\textsl{Min\_count} is used to limit that a pattern needs to repeat
itself at least a certain number of times to demonstrate its
significance and periodicity. Parameter \textsl{Max\_distance} is to
limit that the distance between the same two patterns has to be
within some reasonable bound \cite{AA2004, Patnaik2008, Coan2003}.

\section{Ch2 Ch2}
Usually, \textsl{Min\_count} is set to be a value greater than or
equal to 2, and \textsl{Max\_distance} is set to be \textsl{N}/2,
where \textsl{N} is the length of the time series data. To provide
accurate period patterns for some applications, the length of the
period pattern may be limited \cite{Pippa2016}. Moreover, to provide
efficient processing, some pruning techniques are preferred
\cite{Patnaik2008}.

\subsection{Related}
For the example of the time series data \textsl{abcabdabe}, both
patterns \textsl{ab} and a start in positions 0, 3, 6. In this case,
we usually prefer only a pattern \textsl{ab}. That is, a pattern
\textsl{a} is pruned since it is the subset of a patter \textsl{ab}
in the same starting position. Similarly, a pattern \textsl{b} is
pruned since a pattern \textsl{b} is the subset of patter
\textsl{ab} in the same ending positions.

\subsubsection{Work}
In the past of the structure, the suffix tree is a compact version
of the suffix tries \cite{Pablo2006}. A suffix tree of length
\textsl{m} is a tree with the following properties: (1) Each tree
edge is labelled by a substring of \textsl{S}. (2) Each internal
node has at least 2 children. (3) The number of leaves is m. (4)
Each suffix has its unique leaf. Furthermore, it is well established
in exact string matching and a good introduction to use in biology
(for the example, in constructing and searching the DNA sequence)
\cite{Patnaik2008}.

\section{Related Work}
A suffix tree indexes a string of length \textsl{N} which means that
it has \textsl{N} leaf nodes. When the size of the sequence database
increases, the storage space of a suffix tree also increases. To
reduce the storage space, the suffix array is proposed which is
basically a sorting list of all the suffixes of strings and only the
sorting list is stored \cite{AT2009}. The main advantage of the
suffix array over the suffix tree is that the suffix array uses
three to five times less space.
