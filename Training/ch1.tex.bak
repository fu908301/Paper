\chapter{Introduction}
\vspace*{30pt} Data mining is the process of discovering new
patterns from large datasets. It finds useful information from data
in databases [1]. Periodicity mining is used for predicting trends
in time series data [2, 3, 4]. Applications of periodicity mining in
time series data include temperature, stock prices depicted in the
financial market, gene expression data analysis, etc [5, 6]. In
general, there are three types of periodic patterns which can be
detected in the time series data [4]: (1) symbol periodicity, (2)
sequence periodicity or partial periodic patterns, and (3) segment
or full-cycle periodicity. (Note that the time series data is mostly
discretized before it is analyzed.)
